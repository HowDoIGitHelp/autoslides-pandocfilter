## Introduction

Imperative programming has turned out to be the *natural* paradigm of programming languages.
The members of the imperative programming family have been dominating the market share of programming languages throughout the years with titans like BASIC, Pascal, C, Java and many more.

### Quick Note on Imperative Programming and Procedural Programming

People usually use the terms imperative programming and procedural programming interchangeably.
Procedural programming is a subparadigm of imperative programming family, but some people refer to procedural programming as imperative programming.
That's because other imperative paradigms like object-oriented programming is derived from procedural programming.
You can think procedural programming as the ancestor if other imperative paradigms.

In this lecture I refer to imperative paradigm as a whole, but I will focus on the main ideas that are common between other imperative paradigms.
Ideas from object-oriented programming paradigm can be found on a separate lecture.

## Popularity of the Imperative Paradigm

Imperative programming has turned out to be the *natural* paradigm of programming languages.
The members of the imperative programming family have been dominating the market share of programming languages throughout the years with titans like BASIC, Pascal, C, Java and many more.

If you think about it, this is not that surprising.
This paradigm's dominance could be attributed to most computer scientists’ preference towards **pragmatic** and **efficient** programming languages.
Especially since the most straightforward way of communicating to computer hardware is through the explicit manipulation of CPU memory and registers.

If you want the computer to do something for you, then you *communicate* to the computer that you want this and that to be done.
And if you manage to give the computer correct and comprehensive **instructions** then you'll end up getting what you want.

If we rewind back to the dawn of programming languages you'll see that early programming languages were built to **communicate to computer hardware**.
As a result of this, programming languages naturally adopted syntax with **imperative** moods.

Assembly programs for example was mostly built from sequences of executable instructions which was patterned from imperative statements from natural language.

```assembly
INC ITER
MOV AH,7
ADD AH, AL
```

For example, the assembly instruction `INC ITER`, tells the computer to increment the memory variable called `ITER`.
The instruction `MOV AH, 7`, tells the computer to move the value 7 to the `AH` register.
The instruction `ADD AH, AL` tells the computer to add the contents of the `AH` register to the `AL` register.

As time went by, newer *higher level programming languages* emerged (higher level meaning farther from hardware and closer to human language) like Basic, Pascal, and C.
The syntax of these programming languages were written as **abstractions** of hardware code.
Although programs written in these languages became more human-readable compared to its predecessors, these newer languages retained their imperative tones and mechanisms.
This progression meant that higher level programming languages built atop of imperative languages naturally adopted the **imperative paradigm** as well.
Java, Python, and C++ for example which were all written in C, followed this progression, thus establishing the imperative family as the dominant paradigm in programming language design.

### The STATE

The existence of an explicit state is the foundation of imperative programming.
The **state** of a program or a process on a given instance is the snapshot of its immediate relevant environment and context.
The state of your CPU on a given instance for example will refer to the values found in the *registers and relevant memory*.
On a specific process the state will refer to the values inside the *memory addresses* it resides in.

On a computer program the state can refer the conceptual set of variable values related to the program's runtime on some given instance.
Let's use this program as an example:

```c
int x = 3
int y = 4
x = x + y
```

At the start of runtime, the state of this program would be (*for all intents and purposes*) empty, since there are no relevant variables declared at this point.
After executing the first line of code, the state of the program would look something like this:

| variable | value |
| :------: | :---: |
|   `x`    |   3   |

One integer variable named `x` with the value 3.
After the next line of code a new variable is introduced and immediately assigned with the value 4 so the state of the program at this instance will look like this:

| variable | value |
| :------: | :---: |
|   `x`    |   3   |
|   `y`    |   4   |

And at the last line, the value of `x` is updated by adding the value of `y`, so the final state of this program will look like this:

| variable | value |
| :------: | :---: |
|   `x`    |   7   |
|   `y`    |   4   |

You can inspect the state of a program using *debugging tools* like `gdb` for gcc.
To enable debugging using `gdb`, you need to add the appropriate debug flag (`-g`) during compilation.

```bash
gcc -g program.c -o executable
```

```bash
gdb ./executable
```

##  Assignment Statement

Another important construct of the imperative programming paradigm is the **assignment statement**.
Assignment statements and the concept of state are very related to each other.

Assignment statements allow your program to *mutate* the values of your variables.
Mutation in the context of programming is a fancy term that basically means change[^mutation].
And as we learned earlier, *changes to the context* of a program, which includes variables, creates states.
Therefore, every **assignment statement**, corresponds to **new states** of a for the program.

[^mutation]: When we say "variable mutation" we generally refer to in-place modification. This means that the value is not merely replaced by another value from a different memory address.

Assignment statements are usually executed through the use of the **“`=`”** operator (some languages like Pascal use “`:=`” instead).
Although it borrows the equality operator from math, assignment operators behave very differently from an equality statement.
Instead of communicating some kind proposition[^equality] that says two values are equal, the assignment statement has an **imperative mood**.
Mutation is introduced once you perform an assignment to `a` again, signifying a change in the value of `a`.

The closest corresponding mathematical construct to an assignment statement is the *let statement*.
A statement in math such as "let x be equal to 3", has an **imperative mood**.
But unlike an assignment statement which can change the value of a variable any number of times, a let statement can only set the value of a variable once.

[^equality]: An equality a=b in math declares that some `a` is `b`, while an assignment operator `a=b` commands that `a`'s value is now the same as `b`.

For every assignment statement instructed to the computer corresponds to changes to programs state.

![State changes](../mermaid_diagrams/state_changes.png)

The state of a program changes for every individual mutation of a variable.
And you can compare the difference between the before and after of a specific assignment by comparing the **before-assignment** state and the **after-assignment state**.
The *progression* from one state to another characterizes the effect of an assignment.

This is the important takeaway that you need to remember.
Imperative programming is characterized by **imperative statements**.
Statements that tell the computer what to do.
The most important type of these statements is the **assignment statement**.
An assignment statement's effect to your computer is characterized by the *progression* from one state to another state.

If boil down imperative programs at its most abstract form, it is simply a *combination of assignment statements*.
If arranged in the correct way, a given problem (*initial state*) can progress through multiple states until it reaches the solution (*final state*).

## Structured Program Theorem

Creating meaningful imperative programs is done by applying the **Bohm-Jacopini Theorem**, also known as the **Structured Program Theorem** [@bohm_flow_1966].
This theorem was one of the theoretical frameworks proposed to characterize imperative programming.

The theorem describes a formalism of a class called **control flow graphs** which are capable of representing any computable function.
These control flow graphs are actually something you are intimately familiar of.
It is known to you as the trusty old **flow chart**.
Any control flow graph can be created by combining subprograms in three specific ways.
A subprogram is a recursive unit of control flow graphs.
A subprogram can be a *single assignment statement*, or it can be a *combination* of more than one subprogram.
Here are the three ways to combine subprograms:

1. Executing one subprogram, and then another subprogram (sequence)
2. Executing one of two subprograms according to the value of a boolean (selection)
3. Repeatedly executing a subprogram as long as a boolean expression is true (iteration)

![Flowcharts](../mermaid_diagrams/flowchart.png)

The constructs described by this formalism became the natural architecture for programming language designers.
This is the reason why CS students like you are introduced to programming using control flow graphs or flow charts.
This is also the reason why programming languages like Pascal, C, Java and their derivatives are designed the way they are.

## Subparadigms under the Imperative family

### Procedural programming

Programming languages like Fortran, ALGOL, BASIC, and C fall under the **procedural paradigm**.
Languages under this paradigm simplify a complex system by subdividing a program into different **procedures** or functions.

### Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming focuses on modelling a system based on the real world ontology of **objects**.
It uses an expressive type system to program the interactions within a system.
Most modern programming languages, like C++, Python, Java, etc., have some object-oriented programming features.
