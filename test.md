# A Stateless Paradigm

## Functional purity and the absence of states

One of the most distinguishing aspects of functional programming and the declarative family of languages is its philosophy of statelessness.
A programmer primarily exposed to mutable imperative programming languages will find that the concept of state is natural and maybe even inevitable.
Functional paradigm challenges this concept and offers a much safer and mathematically intuitive philosophy.
In the perspective of functional programming, there is no state, and everything is immutable.

### Pure functions

To understand the functional programming perspective, we have to take a step away from the imperative programming definition of a function.
Let's go back to the definition of a function in mathematics.

Across several, mathematical disciplines a function means the same thing.
Consider two sets $A$ and $B$.
We can define a function as the *mapping* between the elements of $A$ and $B$.
The elements of $A$ and $B$ can be anything, they can be numbers, which shows us how a function can be represented by a formula or a graph.
The elements of $A$ and $B$ can be matrices and vectors, which defines a function as a transformation between two vector spaces.
On the higher level perspective of category theory, functions are *morphisms* between objects of a given category.

$$
f:(A\to B)
$$

If you remember functions from discrete math, functions at its most basic form looks like the one above.

Functions in functional programming languages like Haskell are (arguably) the closest computer representation of a mathematical function.
We call these functions, **pure functions**.

They differ from your standard C function because the definition inside pure functions are only instructions on how to produce a result based on the parameters.
To fully understand this concept here are some examples of impure functions

```c
int square(int x){
	addToExternalLogger("calculating square");
    return x*x;
}
```

The impurity in this function is the line where the function writes to some external logger, `addToExternalLogger("calculating square");`.
A function can only be pure if the result of the function can be fully determined by its parameter.
The only parameter here is `x`.
Invoking this square function with the same parameter value does not do the same thing.
The effect of changing the logger is dependent on the previous state of the external logger.
The effect on the logger is what we call a **side effect** of the `square` function.
It is a side effect since this line of code modifies values outside boundaries of the function.

```c
int* increaseArray(int *a, int size){
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++)
        a[i] = a[i]+1;
}
```

A pass by address/reference function which changes the value of a parameter will automatically be an impure function since changing the value of `a` is a **mutation**, which is a side effect.


```kotlin
fun headsortails(n: Int) {
    val results: MutableList<String> = mutableListOf()
	if ((0..1).random() == 0)
		results.add("Heads")
	else
        results.add("Tails")
    return results
}
```

This function is also impure because the return value is not dependent on the parameters alone.
The return value will be dependent on the randomization seed which is something outside the parameters of the function.

A pure function must satisfy these two:

1. A pure function has no side effects
2. A pure functions output must be dependent on the inputs alone[^function]

[^function]: In fact if $f(a)=b$ and $f(a)=c$ where $b\neq c$, then $f$ is not a function at all

A good way to test if a function is pure is if you can (theoretically) create an infinitely long *lookup table* such that, looking up the value for a specific input is perfectly identical to calling the function with the same input.
And if you think about it this is the essence of a function.
Functions are just of mappings between the domain and the range.

For example, a `square :: Int -> Int` function can be replaced by such look-up table:

| Domain (`x :: Int`) | Range (`(square x) :: Int`) |
|:---:|:---:|
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |
| $-2$     |  $4$     |
| $-1$     |  $1$     |
|  $0$     |  $0$     |
|  $1$     |  $1$     |
|  $2$     |  $4$     |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |

Compare this with the `headsortails()` function in kotlin, which cannot be represented by a lookup table, since the same input can result to different output.

| Domain (`n :: Int`) | Range (`(headsortails(n)) :: MutableList<String>`) |
|:---:|:---:|
| $0$      |  `[]`     |
| $1$      |  `["Heads"]`     |
| $1$      |  `["Tails"]`     |
| $2$      |  `["Heads", "Heads"]`     |
| $2$      |  `["Heads", "Tails]"`     |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |

### Bindings vs Assignment and Referential Transparency

One of the defining features of imperative programming is the assignment statement.
It enables the program to advance to a new state.
Purely functional programming languages like Haskell *do not have assignment statements*.
Therefore, it lacks the mechanism to mutate anything.
Using the "`=`" operator (which signals an assignment statement in imperative languages) in functional languages *binds* the value on the right-hand side to the left-hand side.
This mechanism is conceptually different from an assignment operation in C.
It is perfectly fine to do the following in C:

```C
int x = 0;
x = 1;
```

This code in C starts with a combined declaration and assignment: `int x = 0`.
The second line, **mutates** the value stored in address of `x` to the new value `1`.
Because mutation can happen anytime during runtime, the value of the variable `x` is not definite.
Variables in imperative programming **depend on the current state** of the program.

![States](../mermaid_diagrams/state_changes.png)

Going back to functional programming, if you replicate this C code in Haskell, you'll find that this is not allowed.

```haskell
x = 0
x = 1
```

It will give an error message upon compilation:

```haskell
main.hs:2:1: error:
  Multiple declarations of ‘x’
  Declared at: main.hs:1:1
         main.hs:2:1
```

In Haskell, any "`=`" statement is a declaration of a **binding**.
For example, with `x = 0`, `x` is now **bound** to the value `0`.
These bindings are **final** within its scope.
Anywhere else in the scope, the value of `x` will always be `0`.
Because of this you can predict the evaluation of any expression simply by *replacing* the variable with its bound value.
This property is known as **referential transparency** [@hughes_why_1989].

## Consequences of Functional Purity, Statelessness, and Immutability

Haskell's functions are better representations of mathematical functions. 
But what is the point of faithfully representing mathematical functions?

There are several reasons why programming without state can lead to better code.
Eliminating all side effects is demonstrably *safer* against accidental errors.
Building a library of functions perfectly working without worrying about side effects makes the system easier to understand and more resilient to changes.

```c
void f(int *x, int y){
    *x = *x + y;
    printf("%d\n",*x);
    return;
}
int main(void) {
    int x = 0;
    f(&x, 3);
    x = x - 2;
    f(&x, 3);
}
```

In the previous example, the exact behavior of the function `f()` **depends on where you use it**.
Even if you use the same parameters, you're not guaranteed to get the same results.

On small chunks of code like these, managing the consequences of having side effects will be easy since you can reasonably track the interactions of the variables and the functions.
But when your code grows, the interactions become more complex.
At some point, the function's side effects are not very obvious.

When this happens, using functions and variables without double-checking for side effects becomes much harder.
As a consequence the whole system becomes a nightmare of impure functions on top of impure functions.
Changes to one a variable may unexpectedly affect other parts of the system.
On a corporate setting where multiple people are working on the same codebase, refactoring becomes *unsafe* without knowledge of all the side effects of the functions in use.
On systems with *shared resources* and multi-threading it becomes even more difficult to keep track of things without proper documentation.
These are the consequences of **referential opacity**, the opposite of referential transparency.

This is why functional programming (and other declarative paradigms) come with restrictions by design.
It sacrifices assignment statements and all its derived capabilities to prioritize *safety and readability*.
Without assignment statements, there is no state.
And because of this, functional programming is referentially transparent and therefore easier to trace.
And without assignment statements, all of its functions are pure and have no side effects.

### Statelessness as a paradigm

But at the end of the day, statelessness is just a paradigm.
You can use any programming language and apply the philosophy of statelessness to the programs that your write.

Applying the paradigm of statelessness is just to writing code with more *discipline*.
For example, you can use C and never use global variables.
You can make sure to write only pure functions.
You can be a C programmer and just treat all your variables as immutable and all of your functions as pure.
Imperative languages even help to apply the strict disciplines of statelessness.
For example, C and C++ has a `const` modifier that restricts reassignment.
Kotlin has `val` and immutable classes.
