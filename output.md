## Reimagined functions

- Lambda calculus evolved from a system of logic foundation with deep
  roots to computation theory into something that became a basis for
  *programming language design*.
- Language designers started to consider the unconventional
  representation of lambda calculus expression as a valid and pragmatic
  way of *representing data*.
- One of the earliest and most important of these languages was **Lisp**
  which evolved to become a large family of programming
  languages[@bergin_evolution_1996].
- This opened a new paradigm of programming languages called
  **functional programming paradigm**.
- To explore this paradigm this section will introduce the programming
  language **Haskell**.

---

### How functions are treated Differently

- One of the biggest difference between your classic imperative
  programming languages like C and Java and a functional programming
  language, is how it treats its *functions*.

---

### How functions are treated Differently

``` c
int square(int x){
    return x*x;
}
```

---

### How functions are treated Differently

- It has a **name** to invoke it later called `square`, it has
  **specifications** on which type of data it accepts (`int x`) and
  produces (`int`), and finally it has **instructions** on what must be
  done when it is invoked (`return x*x`). Functional programming
  functions behave in more or less the same way.

---

### How functions are treated Differently

``` haskell
square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x
```

---

### How functions are treated Differently

``` c
square(5);
```

---

### How functions are treated Differently

``` haskell
square 5
```

---

### How functions are treated Differently

- Although functions in non-functional programming behave and look
  similar to functions in functional programming language, they have a
  huge difference in the way the programming language *treats* it.

---

### How functions are treated Differently

- In fact C programmers will rarely call a function a *value*.
- What this means is that canonical value types like integers,
  characters, and arrays (even compound value like `struct` instances
  and objects) can be *passed* on functions and can be *returned* as
  functions.

---

### How functions are treated Differently

``` c
int* add_to_array(int arr*,int x,int size){
    for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
        arr[i]+x;
    }
    return arr;
}
```

---

### How functions are treated Differently

- Therefore, during runtime, non-functional programming languages
  interpret the expression `square(5)` as "the number $5$ squared" while
  the expression `square` is just some disembodied function name
  (*square of which number?*).

---

#### Passing functions

- Functional programming languages treat functions the same way it
  treats values, you *can* pass them in other functions, and you *can*
  return them as well.

---

#### Passing functions

``` haskell
s :: Int -> Int
s x = x + 1

p :: Int -> Int
p x = x - 1

applytwice :: (Int-> Int) -> Int -> Int
applytwice f x = f (f x)
```

---

#### Passing functions

- The code above shows two function definitions with some *type
  signature annotations* for readability.
- The first is the function `s :: Int -> Int` which is *applied to an
  integer* and *produces an integer*.

---

#### Passing functions

- Type signature annotations are not required here, that's why they're
  called *annotations*.
- Adding these annotations will *restrict* the type the functions can be
  applied to.

---

#### Passing functions

``` haskell
f :: Paramtype -> AnotherParamtype -> ... -> OutputType
```

---

#### Passing functions

- A **higher order function** is a function that either accepts a
  function as a parameter or returns a function parameter or both.
- The function `applytwice`, as described by its *type signature*, is
  applied to a function `f` and an integer `x`and produces an integer.

---

#### Passing functions

``` haskell
ghci> applytwice s 3
5
ghci> applytwice p 3
1
```

---

#### Passing functions

`$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{let } S &= \lambda n .\lambda s. \lambda z. (s(nsz))\\
T &= \lambda f. \lambda x. (f(fx))\\
\overline 5&=TS\overline{3}
\end{aligned}
$$`

---

#### Passing functions

- In lambda calculus an *abstraction* and an *application* does not
  restrict anyone from the type of expressions bound to variables.

---

#### Returning functions

- On the other side of the coin, a function, in functional programming
  will also let you *return functions* the same way you *return* any
  other kind of data.

---

#### Returning functions

``` haskell
addTwo :: Int -> Int
addTwo x = x + 2

addThree :: Int -> Int
addThree x = x + 3

addFour :: Int -> Int
addFour x = x + 4
```

---

#### Returning functions

- We can generalize these functions into a *function-maker* function,
  that when applied to an arbitrary integer `x`, will produce a function
  similar to `addx` which is a function that adds `x` to your integer.

---

#### Returning functions

``` haskell
addMaker :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
addMaker x = (\y -> x + y)
```

---

#### Returning functions

- The definition for your `addMaker` (`\y -> x + y`) is basically an
  implementation of the following *lambda expression*.

---

#### Returning functions

`$$
\lambda y. \text{add }x y
$$`

---

#### Returning functions

- What this expression means then is that `addMaker` *produces a lambda
  expression*, which essentially behaves exactly like a function.

---

#### Returning functions

``` haskell
ghci> addSix = addMaker 6
```

---

#### Returning functions

- Simply writing the expression `addSix` on your terminal will yield you
  an *error*, because printing `addSix` doesn't really have a meaning
  outside the world of lambda calculus.
- It is a lambda expression which is *basically* a function.
- *How do you represent a function as a string?*

---

#### Returning functions

``` haskell
ghci> addSix 3
9
```

---

#### Returning functions

``` haskell
ghci> (addMaker 7) 4
11
```

---

#### Returning functions

- This nifty trick right here is the reason why lambda expressions are
  also called **anonymous functions** since these expressions on their
  own don't have a name.

---

#### Returning functions

``` haskell
ghci> applytwice (\x -> x + 2) 3
7
ghci> (\x -> x * x) 4
16
```

---

#### Returning functions

- Doing this will **name** the lambda thus allowing it to behave just
  like any other named function.

---

##### Closure

- A higher order function like `addMaker` above, is not *only* producing
  the lambda inside its definition.
- What is actually being produced is a construct called a **closure**
  which is the function definition described by the *lambda* and the
  *environment* of the function call.
- Without passing the *environment*, the variable `x` would be a free
  variable which will yield you a compilation error.

---

##### Closure

- Inside your `addmaker` when you evaluate `addMaker 6`, the parameter
  `6` is *bound* to the variable $x$.

---

## Currying

`$$
\lambda x. \mathcal{M}
$$`

---

## Currying

- One can argue that this is different from how functional programming
  represents its own functions and lambdas since functions with
  *multiple parameters* are allowed in these languages.
- As it turns out, these functions are just *disguised* to have multiple
  parameters.
- These functions are just several single parameter functions combined
  to *simulate* multiple parameter functions.

---

## Currying

``` haskell
plus x y = x + y
```

---

## Currying

- Internally, this function is equivalent to two lambda calculus
  abstractions, nested together to simulate *multiparameterness*.

---

## Currying

``` haskell
plus = \x -> (\y -> x + y)
```

---

## Currying

`$$
\text{plus}=\lambda x.\lambda y. \text{add }x y
$$`

---

## Currying

- Just like lambda calculus, Haskell's `->` operator is right
  associative, so you can write the same *plus* function as:

---

## Currying

``` haskell
plus = \x -> \y -> x + y
```

---

## Currying

``` haskell
plus = \x y -> x + y
```

---

## Currying

`$$
\lambda xy.\text{add }xy
$$`

---

## Currying

``` haskell
ghci> (plus 3) 4
7
```

---

## Currying

- Which means that: first, we are evaluating `(plus 3)` which will give
  us a *closure*.
- The closure is then *applied* to `4` which completes the evaluation to
  `7`.

---

## Currying

`$$
(\text{plus }\overline{3}) \overline 4
$$`

---

## Currying

``` haskell
ghci> plus 3 4
7
```

---

## Currying

``` haskell
plus x y = x + y

plus = \x -> (\y -> x + y)
```

---

## Currying

- The expression `(plus 3)` has a special name, it is called a **partial
  application**.
- When you apply a function that is supposed to accept $n$ parameters to
  $m$ values (where $m<n$), i.e. you are supplying the function *less
  parameters* than it is expecting.
- Instead of getting the value, you get a partial application of that
  function which will evaluate to a *closure*.

---

## Currying

- The process of converting a multiparameter function or lambda to a
  nested single parameter lambda is called **currying**.

---

## Currying

``` haskell
addFifteen = \x -> 15 + x
```

---

## Currying

``` haskell
addFifteen = plus 15
```

---

## Currying

``` haskell
addFifteen = plus 15
addFifteen = (\x -> (\y -> x + y)) 15
addFifteen = \y -> 15 + y
addFifteen = \x -> 15 + x --alpha equivalent to the lambda above
```

---

## Currying

``` haskell
ghci> (+) 3 2
5
```

---

## Currying

``` haskell
ghci> applytwice (+ 3) 4
10
```
