# Strategy pattern

---

# Problem

![strategy](../../copyright_free_drawings/strategy.png)

---

# Solution

![Strategy pattern](../../uml/umlOutputs/Strategy.svg)

---
class: center, middle

# Example

---

# Fraction Calculations

- `left` - represents the left operand fraction
- `right` - represents the right operand fraction
- `operation` - represents the operation ($+$,$-$,$\times$,$\div$)
- `answer` - represents the solution of the operation

---

# Fraction Calculations

![strategy pattern example](../../uml/umlOutputs/FractionCalculator.svg)

---

# Why this is elegant

- **Open/Closed Principle** - If you want to add new strategies, you
  wouldn't need to touch any existing code.
- The implementation of a strategy is deeply tucked inside multiple
  layers of encapsulation. Changing these implementations are very easy.
- You can swap strategies during runtime in the same way you do in
  functional programming.

---

# How to implement it

1.  Create an abstract `Strategy` that contains an abstract method
    called `execute`. This method should be specified to accept all the
    necessary parameters needed by your parameterized function.
2.  For every strategy, the higher order method can accept, you create a
    realization for `Strategy` and implement the correct behavior in
    `execute`.

---

# How to implement it

3.  The higher order function should now be specified to accept a
    `strategy` of type `Strategy`.
4.  Inside the higher order function, whenever it wants to perform the
    strategies embedded behavior, call `strategy.execute(...)`.

# State Pattern

---

# Problem

![State](../../copyright_free_drawings/state.png)

---

# Solution

![state pattern](../../uml/umlOutputs/State.svg)

---

# Solution

![state diagram](../../uml/statediagram.png)

---
class: center, middle

# Example

---

# States of matter

![state diagram example](../../uml/statediagramexample.png)

---

# States of matter

> Delegating behavior to the composed state means that, when the
> `Matter` instances invoke, `compress()`, `release()` `heat()`, and
> `cool()`, the composed `State` owned by the matter calls its own
> version of `compress()`, `relaease()` `heat()`, and `cool()`.

---

# States of matter

![state example](../../uml/umlOutputs/StatesOfMatter.svg)

---

# States of matter

> Matter owns an instance of `State`, and that instance has an attribute
> called `matter`. The attribute `matter` is the reference to the
> instance of `Matter` that owns it. The `State` instance needs this
> reference so that it can change the matter's state when it is
> compressed, released, heated, or cooled.

---

# Why this is elegant

- **Single Responsibility Principle** - behavior related to state is
  delegated to the state itself.
- **Open/Closed Principle** - You can incorporate new states to the
  system without touching any existing client code
- Implementing this pattern will remove bulky and annoying state
  conditionals

---

# How to implement it

1.  Create an abstract `State` that contains abstract methods for all
    state dependent behavior (context related behaviors that are
    dependent on context's state).
2.  For every state the `Context` can have, create a realization of
    `State`.
3.  `Context` owns an attribute that represents the current state
    (`currentState`) that it owns.

---

# How to implement it

4.  If the state needs to control the `Context` instance that owns it,
    add a backreference to `Context` inside state.
5.  Whenever a `Context` instance performs state dependent methods, it
    calls `currentState.stateDependentBehavior()` instead so that its
    behavior is dependent on its current state.

# Command Pattern

---

# Problem

![Command (What does this strange picture
mean?)](../../copyright_free_drawings/command.png)

---

# Solution

- These problems have a common solution, the **command pattern**.

---

# Solution

- If you want to keep a history of the performed commands, the `Invoker`
  may keep a list of `Commands`. This way the data stored in the list
  history, is a perfect representation of the previous commands.

- If you want the `Commands` to be undoable, you can store a backup of
  the receiver (and other affected objects) by the `Command` inside each
  instance of `Command` . Undoing a command will be as simple as
  restoring the receiver to its backup.

---

# Solution

![command example](../../uml/umlOutputs/Command.svg)

---

# Solution

> Instead of passing the receiver in the `Invoker` methods, you can
> create an attribute called receiver inside `Invoker`. But doing this
> will make it so there is one `Receiver` instance for every `Invoker`
> instance.
>
> The commands should only affect the receiver. If the behavior that is
> performed changes a lot of objects, then make a `Receiver` class that
> encapsulates all of the affected objects. Doing this will make the
> implementation of undo easier since the backup inside of the command
> will simply be an older version of `Receiver`.
>
> Different command realizations are not necessarily of the same
> `Strategy`. That's why the parameters of the behavior are stored as
> attributes of the command, not passed in the `execute()` function.
> This is so that no matter what the command is, all `execute()`
> functions will have the same type signatures.

# Example

---

# Zooming through a maze

- `Board` - this represents the layout of the maze. The layout is loaded
  from a file. It has these attributes:
  - `__isSolid` - this is a 2 dimensional grid encoded as a nested list
    of booleans which represents the solid boundaries of the maze. For
    example if `__isSolid[row][col]` is true then it means that that
    cell on (row,col) is a boundary
  - `__start` - a tuple of two integers that represent where the
    character starts
  - `__end` - tuple of two integers that represent the position of the
    end of the maze
  - `__cLoc` - tuple of two integers that represents the current
    location of the character
  - `moveUp()`, `moveDown()`, `moveLeft()`, `moveRight()` - moves the
    character one space, in the respective direction. The character
    cannot move to a boundary cell, it will raise an error instead.
  - `canMoveUp()`, `canMoveDown()`, `canMoveLeft()`, `canMoveRight()` -
    returns true if the cell in the respective direction is not solid.
  - `__str()__` string representation of the board. It shows which are
    the boundaries and the character location

---

# Zooming through a maze

- `dpad_up()`, `dpad_down()`, `dpad_left()`, `dpad_right()` - The
  character dashes through the maze in the specified direction until it
  hits a boundary.
- `a_button()` - The character undoes the previous action it did.

---

# Zooming through a maze

![command example](../../uml/umlOutputs/ZoomingThroughAMaze.svg)

---

# Why this is elegant

- **Single Responsibility Principle** - The behavioral responsibilities
  in the system are thoroughly separated. One invokes the command, and
  the other performs the behavior associated with the command.
- **Open/Closed Principle** - If there are more commands you want to
  add, you don't have to touch any existing code.
- Switching between invokers and receivers is easily done

---

# Why this is elegant

- You can implement undo (and redo)
- You can defer the execution of behavior
- A command may be made of smaller simpler commands

---

# How to implement it

1.  Create an abstraction `Command` that contains abstract method
    `execute()`, and other command related methods like `undo()`.
2.  For every command, create a realization to `Command`. These commands
    uses a reference to a `Reciever` instance. This instance represents
    the instance/s that are affected whenever `Command` realizations are
    executed.

---

# How to implement it

3.  Create an `Invoker` class that will be responsible for
    instantiating, preparing, and executing commands. Inside these class
    are methods for invoking each commands. When these methods are
    called, the invoker does the following:
    1.  Instantiate an instance of `Command` called `c` with the correct
        realization.
    2.  select the receiver of the `Command`, including the related
        parameters.
    3.  invoke `c.execute()`.

---

# How to implement it

4.  If the system supports undoable commands, the `Invoker` should keep
    a list of commands called `commandHistory` and each command instance
    should keep a reference called `backup` to enable restoration of
    `Reciever` instances.

# Observer Pattern

---

# Problem

![observer](../../copyright_free_drawings/observer.png)

---

# Solution

![observer](../../uml/umlOutputs/Observer.svg)

---

# Solution

> Whenever an observer has updated, the publisher needs to pass all the
> necessary details in the notification. This is generally done by
> passing the updated subject in the `update(updatedSubject)` method.
>
> In some cases, the observer needs to keep a copy of the subject as an
> attribute. Make sure to change the value of this attribute during
> updates.
>
> Make sure that changes to the subject are only done using the
> `Publisher` class (`manipulateSubject()`). If you change the subject
> without using `Publisher`'s methods, your subscribers won't be
> notified.

---
class: center, middle

# Example

---

# Push Notifier for Weather and Headlines

- `EmailSubscriber` - every time the `currentWeather` or
  `currentHeadline` changes you send an email to the specified `email`.
  (you don't have to actually send an email. You can just simulate
  sending an email by printing something like "sending
  `<weather>`{=html} and `<headline>`{=html} to `<email>`{=html}").
- `FileLogger` - every time the `currentWeather` or `currentHeadline`
  changes, you append the updated weather and headline to the file
  specified in the attribute `filename`. You actually have to update a
  file via kotlin/python file writing.

---

# Push Notifier for Weather and Headlines

![observer example](../../uml/umlOutputs/WeatherNotifier.svg)

---

# Why this is elegant

- **Open/Closed Principle** - You can add new `Observer` realizations
  seamlessly every time there are new objects that are interested in the
  subject.
- A observer can be subscribed/unsubscribed during runtime

---

# How to implement it

1.  Create an `Observer` abstraction that represents all classes that
    can potentially observe changes to the `Publisher`. `Observer` will
    contain the abstract method `update()`.
2.  All classes that want to be notified about changes to the `subject`
    should realize `Observer`.
3.  `Publisher` will either own/use an instance of the `subject` of
    interest. It will also use an attribute which is stores the list of
    `Observers` that are interested in the subject. To attach or detach
    `Observer`s, `Publisher` contains the methods `subscribe()` and
    `unsubscribe()`.

---

# How to implement it

4.  Every time `subject` is manipulated, it should be done through
    `Publisher` , because `Publisher` needs to notify all `Observers` in
    its observer list attribute after every manipulation. This
    notification is done through `notifyObservers()` after the end of
    every subject manipulation.
5.  Inside the `Publisher`s `notifyObservers` method, every `Observer`
    in its list of observers invoke their `update()` method.

# Template Method Pattern

---

# Problem

- Say you have two or more *almost* identical behaviors from different
  classes.

---

# Problem

![template](../../copyright_free_drawings/template.png)

---

# Solution

- This superclass will also contain the common implementation for the
  **template method**, the method that combines all steps into the
  original object behavior.

---

# Solution

![template method](../../uml/umlOutputs/Template.svg)

---

# Solution

> The steps in the superclass can be a mix of abstract methods and
> concrete methods. Make a method abstract if you want to force all
> specializations to override these steps. You'll want to do these if
> some of the steps in your template doesn't have a default
> implementation.

# Example

---

# Brute Force Recipe

- **Equality Search**

---

# Brute Force Recipe

``` kotlin
#searchSpace = [2,3,1,0,6,2,4]
#target = 2

i = 0
solutions = []
candidate = searchSpace[0]
```

---

# Brute Force Recipe

``` kotlin
while(i<len(searchSpace)):
    if candidate == target:
        solutions.add(candidate)
    candidate = searchSpace[++i]
    
#solution = [2,2]
```

---

# Brute Force Recipe

- **Divisibility Search**

---

# Brute Force Recipe

``` kotlin
#searchSpace = [2,3,1,0,6,2,4]
#target = 2

i = 0
solutions = []
candidate = searchSpace[0]
```

---

# Brute Force Recipe

``` kotlin
while(i<len(searchSpace)):
    if candidate % target == 0:
        solution.add(candidate)
    candidate = searchSpace[++i]
    
#solution = [2,0,6,2,4]
```

---

# Brute Force Recipe

- **Minimum Search**

---

# Brute Force Recipe

``` kotlin
#searchSpace = [2,3,1,0,6,2,4]
#target = None

i = 1
solutions = [searchSpace[0]]
candidate = searchSpace[1]
```

---

# Brute Force Recipe

``` kotlin
while(i<len(searchSpace)):
    if candidate <= solutions[0]
        solutions[0] = candidate
    candidate = searchSpace[++i]
    
#solution = [0]
```

---

# Brute Force Recipe

- **Common Recipe**

---

# Brute Force Recipe

``` python
i = 0
solutions = []
candidate = first()
while(isStillSearching()):
```

---

# Brute Force Recipe

``` python
    if valid(candidate):
        updateSolution(candidate)
    candidate = next()
```

---

# Brute Force Recipe

![template example](../../uml/templateexample.svg)

---

# Brute Force Recipe

> is `isValid()` and `updateSolution(candidate)` is different for each
> algorithm so it doesn't have a default implementation. It would be
> best to make these steps abstract.

---

# Why this is elegant

- **Open/Closed Principle** - The `Template` is open for extension but
  closed for modification

- *Encapsulate what varies* - steps can vary from specialization to
  specialization, therefore they are encapsulated into step methods.

- Implementing this pattern will remove duplicate code in the common
  parts of the algorithm.

- Clients may override only certain steps in a large algorithm, making
  it easier to create specializations

---

# How to implement it

1.  Create an abstract class called `Template`. It contains the method
    `templateMethod()` broken down into separate steps through separate
    `step1()`, `step2()`, ... and etc. methods. When invoked
    `templateMethod()` will just call these step methods.
2.  Each step method inside `Template` will contain the default
    implementation of that step. If there is no default implementation,
    the method should be abstract.

---

# How to implement it

3.  For every similar behavior to `templateMethod()` a specialization of
    `Template` is created. These methods will implement all abstract
    methods and override all step methods that vary for its behavior.

# Iterator

---

# Problem

- One of the most common iteration recipes that you'll likely implement
  is the **for-each** loop.

---

# Problem

![iterator](../../copyright_free_drawings/iterator.png)

---

# Solution

``` python
i = collection.newIterator()
while i.hasNext():
    print(i.next())
```

---

# Solution

![iterator](../../uml/umlOutputs/Iterator.svg)

---

# Why this is elegant

- **Single Responsibility Principle** - Traversal algorithms can now be
  placed into separate classes that interact with an iterator instead of
  the collection itself.
- **Open/Closed Principle** - You can implement new types of collections
  and iterators without touching any existing code.

---

# Why this is elegant

- You can traverse all the elements in a collection, even if you don't
  know the exact type of the said collection.
- Two iterators, can iterate over the same collection without problem as
  long as the iterators are of different instances.

---

# How to implement it

1.  Create an abstraction called `Iterator` which contains the abstract
    methods `next()` and `hasNext()`.
2.  Create an abstraction called `Collection` which contains the
    abstract method `newIterator()`.

---

# How to implement it

3.  For very collection that can be iterated through create a
    realization to `Collection`. Inside these `Collection` realizations,
    the `newIterator()` method must be implemented which simply returns
    a new instance of the default `Iterator`. (for collections that can
    be iterated through in more than one way, create different methods
    for creating other iterators as well but always keep `newIterator()`
    as the one that returns a new instance of the default iteration).
4.  For every different way of iterating through a `Collection`
    realization, a realization to `Iterator` must be created as well.

---

# How to implement it

5.  `Iterator` realizations should contain an attribute that refers to
    the collection instance it is iterating through.
